# My Wellness Planner

Welcome to My Wellness Planner! Our goal is to become an all-in-one productivity and life enhancement tool that helps you accomplish all the things that matter most to you. Whether it be to set up an appointment with your doctor, go to the dreaded DMV to renew your license, workout for 30 minutes, save $100 this month, read a book, or do some yoga; we give you the tools to write it, track it and get rewarded for it.

In today's day and age, it can be easier and easier to find things to distract you from doing what you really need to do whether it be chores and tasks around the house or things that have been proven to increase your quality of life. And if you're like us, keeping track of those things is half the battle. That's where we come in. With our clean and simple UI and intuitive design, we allow you to easily track everything you need to do and categorize it as you see fit.

Now, I know what you're thinking. "Haven't we seen this idea before? Isn't it called Notepad??" Fair question. But the difference between us and the rest of the "To Do List" apps is our functionality to offer you challenges and reward you for completing those challenges. For example, let's say during the month of April, you have a list that looks like this.

- Take car into the shop
- Call grandma
- Finish one book
- Workout once a week
- Mediate for 10 minutes every day
- Take kids to get haircuts

Each task is given points - if you complete the task, you get the points. If you complete all your tasks for the month, you get that month’s badge along with all the points accumulated. If you have an extra busy month and don't get to everything that you wanted to do, no worries! You still get the points for the tasks that you did complete, you just won't get the badge for that month.

Now, each category can be tracked separately. What does that mean? Say we have a category for reading. What sounds better, doing one big checkmark on your monthly reading goal once you finish that 300-page novel or logging incremental chunks of reading that you do throughout the month? For me, I like to be able to see my progress as I read through each chapter and then get tired and watch YouTube. So, we give you the option to either log time towards a goal or simply cross it off once you finish. It's up to you.

The other aspect of individually tracked categories is that your overall level can improve over time. Let's look at another example, say biking. You bought a bike at the beginning of the pandemic hoping you would finally have more time to ride. And you did! At least for that first week... But now you're ready to dust off the ol' 10 speed and hit the trails again. You can create a category for biking, add in some monthly goals and we reward you points for completing those goals. Now let's say you stick with biking for that whole month and the next three months, we see how well you're doing and maybe offer you some more challenging goals, let's say instead of biking 10 miles, bike 20? The more you complete, the more points you get and the higher level you become.

So, what do you do with all these points and badges? Well, that's up to you. You can print them out and frame them, you can share them with your friends, redeem monetary-value items or just throw them away (or recycle them I guess.) Been sticking with your new-year’s resolution of working out three days a week? Great, show off your exercise badges to your friends and get some bragging rights. Maybe you've been trying to learn a new language and for the past year you've logged over 1,000 hours of study-time and earned over 5,000 points! Redeem those points with one of our sponsors and get some awesome prizes. Increíble!

We can also offer you area-based challenges which you have the option of accepting or rejecting. Say that you have a running goal, and we notice there is a 5k in your city next month. Add that to your plan and start training. Complete that goal and you get the "Hell on Earth Halloween 5k" Badge - yes this is a real thing. Add this to your collection of badges and earn some more bragging rights with your friends!

Maybe you're thinking "I like the idea, but I don't even know what I would add in my goals." That's fine, we can help! With our intuitive suggestion algorithm, we can offer you challenges and goals that we think you would enjoy. Maybe you listed playing guitar as one of your hobbies and interests. We can offer you a goal of playing guitar for an hour a day for one month. If you enjoy the challenge, give it a smiley face in the review, if you didn't care for it all that much, give it a frowny face or if you dislike the suggestions altogether you can disable this feature. (It won't hurt our feelings)
